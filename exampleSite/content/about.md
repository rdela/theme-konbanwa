# Hi there

Thanks to [Radek](https://radoslawkoziel.pl), author of the
[Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) theme
 from which [Konbanwa](https://github.com/rdela/theme-konbanwa) derives.

The theme includes:

- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)

So, there you have it... enjoy!
